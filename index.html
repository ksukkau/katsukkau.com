        <div class="aboutmetext">
          <p>I am currently a student at BCIT in Computer Systems Technology. I love learning and am always working on
            learning something new. I come from a telecommunications technical and customer support background. From
            that, I gained the skills to investigate and resolve issues and developed excellent communication skills.
          </p>
          <p>I am passionate about the possibilities technology gives us to improve the world around us. I believe we
            have the chance to better the world around us with the things we make. </p>
          <p>Outside of programming, I am also an artist of traditional mediums, such as ink on paper. I bring that
            creativity to everything I do, and I enjoy the opportunity programming provides to create.</p>

            <h2>Random Episode Picker</h2>
            <p>I created this episode picker to select a random episode from multiple seasons of a tv show. In this
              case, I selected the show Star Trek.<p>
                <p>I wrote this app in Python. I used the Tkinter library to create a basic GUI and used random
                  functionality to pick episodes. The episode can either be selected completely randomly with the random
                  button or randomly from a specific series using the button corresponding to that series.</p>
                <p>With over 800 episodes collecting the data efficiently was important so I used web scraping with
                  Python. I created a CSV file for the program to read. During this, I ran into problems getting all the
                  data in the same format, due to having to access multiple sites. It took a few iterations to get this
                  correct.
                  I also manually cleaned up some of the data. <a

            <h2>CovidBites</h2>
            <p>In a team of 3, over the first term we worked on developing a web app to allow people to find safe places
              to dine out during the covid-19 pandemic. </p>
            <p>We used Firestore and Firebase to create our user logins and save user and restaurant information. The
              app allows users to search for restaurants and leave reviews. We planned to use crowdsourced information
              to verify mask policies and headcounts in restaurants. We hope to add this in a future update. </p>
            <p>Using JavaScript I built the user profile page which pulls the users' information (name, email) and
              provides a personal greeting. I also created the check for user login and the logout functionality on the
              profile page. </p>
            <p>Throughout, I learned a lot about user-centred design and agile methodology. I also learned about working

              on where on the paddle it contacts. The game runs to 3 points at which point it declares a winner and is
              paused until the user clicks the mouse. </p>
